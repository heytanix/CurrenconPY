# CurrenconPY

**CurrenconPY** is a Python-based currency converter that allows users to convert one currency to another using real-time exchange rates from the **ExchangeRate-API**. This tool is simple yet effective for quick currency conversions with accurate data fetched directly from the API.

## Features

- **Real-Time Exchange Rates**: Fetches the latest exchange rates using the **ExchangeRate-API**.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Allows the user to specify the base currency, target currency, and the amount to be converted.
- **Accurate Calculations**: Converts the input amount based on the real-time exchange rate retrieved from the API.
- **Cross-Currency Support**: Supports conversion between a wide range of currencies.

## How it Works

1. User inputs the **base currency** (e.g., USD).
2. User inputs the **target currency** (e.g., EUR).
3. User inputs the **amount** to convert.
4. CurrenconPY fetches the most recent exchange rate from **ExchangeRate-API** and computes the equivalent value in the target currency.
5. The result is displayed in the terminal.

### Example Usage

```bash
Enter the base currency (example: USD): USD
Enter the target currency (example: INR): INR
Enter the amount to convert: 100
